## Problem

There is an API endpoint called /api/deadline which returns { secondsLeft: number } JSON object containing the number of seconds left to some constant deadline date (deadline date never changes). Write an Angular component (and any other Angular classes/functions if needed) that will retrieve data from backend and will display ‚ÄúSeconds left to deadline: X‚Äù countdown timer (X should be updated every second). Please take your time to write performance optimized code that could be then copy-pasted into some bigger Angular project.
